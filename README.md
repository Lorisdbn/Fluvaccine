# H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines Learning and Predictions

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether individuals received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines using a variety of machine learning models. Leveraging data from a public health survey conducted during the H1N1 pandemic, this project explores key factors influencing vaccination behavior, such as demographic information, health beliefs, and behaviors.

## Key Features

- **Data exploration and visualization**: the project begins with a thorough exploration of the dataset, identifying key variables and patterns through various visualizations.

- **Data processing**: we meticulously handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and standardize the dataset to prepare it for effective machine learning model training.

- **Model training and evaluation**: multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, are trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate predictors of vaccine uptake. Techniques like SMOTE are applied to address class imbalance.

- **Prediction and interpretation**: The best-performing models are used to predict vaccine uptake on a test set. The project includes detailed interpretations of the predictions and their implications for public health strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for data processing, modeling, and visualization.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application that showcases the project's findings.
- **TensorFlow**: Used for implementing and running the neural network models.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Essential for data processing and model evaluation.
- **Plotly**: For creating dynamic and interactive visualizations.
